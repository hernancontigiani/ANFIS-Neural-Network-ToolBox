# ANFIS-Neural-Network-ToolBox
C++ ANFIS  class for multipurpose project

This project was released in 2015, the goal was to develop a ANFIS Neural Network in C++ and then make a tool to train and create neural networks models.

In this repository you will find de ANFIS c++ class to implement in your project.

Next pictures are a GUI called ANFIS ToolBox builded in QTcrestor (not longer available) used to test and use the ANFIS c++ classes with a user interface. I suggeste from your side build something similar to better analyse de data and the results

You could observe how the model is evolute and take the form of the desired input/output relationship

And have a report about how the model performance and the training progress

Enjoy :smile:!!
