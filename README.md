# ANFIS-Neural-Network-ToolBox
C++ ANFIS  class for multipurpose project

This project was released on 2013, the objective was develop a ANFIS Neural Network in C++ and then make a tool to train and create neural networks model.

In this repository you will finde de ANFIS c++ class to implement in your project.

Apart of that you could use the out of the box ANFIS ToolBox to make some machine learning and play around.
